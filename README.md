# 2D-Soft-Body-Customizer
This project is exploratory and tries to achieve three main goals.
- Code a soft body simulation with triangles inside a shape (triangles presserve angles)
- Code a soft body simulation with pressure
- Code a soft body simulation with constraining the object to it's casted "equilibrium uncompressed state"

There are many features to this project:
- Multiple objects
- Customizable obstacles
- Toggle any and all three for a shape with minimal inputs (desired dimensions and stretchiness of the shape)

Future aspirations include making a three dimensional simulation and more mouse interactive options

This was inspired by a video, no other resources were used:
